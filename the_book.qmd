## Variables in Model : Analysts & Coaches {#variables-in-model--analysts--coaches}

+------------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Outcome Variable       | Game Data                       | Play Data                        |
+========================+=================================+==================================+

|                        |                                 | - Game time remaining (binned)[^7]|

[^3]: Quantitative : 1 - 60 & Categorical / Bins : [1, 5], [6, 15], [16, 25], [26, 38], [39 to 45], [46, 60]
[^4]: Expected Points Added (EPAs) are a measure of the expected point value at the start of a play. Various aggregated and lagged measures - for both teams, offensive pass & run game, defensive pass & run game.
[^5]: ELO ratings are used to rank teams and specific features of a team based on their performance. Various aggregated and lagged measures - for both teams, offensive pass & run game, defensive pass & run game
[^6]: Categorical / Bins : (-∞,17], [-16,-9], [-8,-4], [-3,0], [1,3], [4, 8], [9, 16], [17,∞)
[^7]: Categorical / Bins : First Quarter : [15,0], Second Quarter : [15,4), [4, 2), [2,0], Third Quarter: [15,0], Fourth Quarter : [15, 7), [7, 4), [4, 2), [2, 0]
[^8]: Score difference time ratio is addressing the relationship between score differential and time remaining. The average time remaining for each bin of time remaining and most frequently occurring score differential for each bin to calculate this measure
